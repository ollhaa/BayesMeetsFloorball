# BayesMeetsFloorball
Estimating shooting percentages by using prior information. Also some predictions. 

*The idea for this blog post came from the desire to combine floorball and data analysis and learn a little bit about web scraping. The methods are mainly from the blog* [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical_bayes_baseball/). *I also noticed that the same idea has been used before by* [Ilari Scheinin](https://ilari.scheinin.fi/ranking-nhls-best-shooters/). *My own added value is to apply this to floorball, do some explanatory data analysis and predict the final number of goals scored by each player.*

*The data is from [F-liiga](https://fliiga.com/fi/miehet/) and was obtained by web scraping. F-liiga is the highest level of floorball in Finland.*
